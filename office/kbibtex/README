KBibTeX is a BibTeX editor for KDE to edit bibliographies used with 
LaTeX. Features include comfortable input masks, starting web queries
(e. g. Google or PubMed) and exporting to PDF, PostScript, RTF and
XML/HTML. As KBibTeX is using KDE's KParts technology, KBibTeX can 
be embedded into Kile or Konqueror. It has been written by Thomas 
Fischer and is released under the GPL 2.
