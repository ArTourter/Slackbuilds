This is a set of widget styles for Gtk2 based apps.

The fonts and colours for the GTK themes will be read in from your Qt 
settings so any KDE font/colour changes will also affect your GTK apps.

If you want Gtk2 apps to use the theme system wide, create a symbolic link to the new 
theme like this:
  ln -s /usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc

Note that in Slackware 13.1 KDE and gtk assumes different things. KDE will override the
PATH in which gtk apps looks for the rc file and make them look in /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc.
However if you are not using KDE you should use the /etc/gtk-2.0/*-slackware-linux/gtkrc
PATH instead as this is where gtk apps looks for by default.

Alternatively, gtk-chtheme (also available as a slackbuild) works fine on a per user basis.
