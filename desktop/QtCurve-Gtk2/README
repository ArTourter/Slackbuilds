This is a set of widget styles for Gtk2 based apps.

The fonts and colours for the GTK themes will be read in from your Qt 
settings so any KDE font/colour changes will also affect your GTK apps.

If you want Gtk2 apps to use the theme, create a symbolic link to the new 
theme like this:
  ln -s /usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
