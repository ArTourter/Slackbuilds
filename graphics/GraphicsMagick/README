GraphicsMagick (GraphicsMagick Image Processing System)
 
GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. it 
provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries
which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in over 88 
major formats.

Image processing can multi-threaded using OpenMP (GCC 4.2 or later) so
that CPU-bound tasks scale linearly as processor cores are added. However
OpenMP is disabled by default in the package due to a bug in GCC 4.2
which make perl binding and other bindings not work. Openmp can be enabled
by giving the option OPENMP=yes to the build script.

Support for JPEG-2000 requires JasPer. Other additional optional
requirements can be found at
